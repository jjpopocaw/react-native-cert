            "We don't have a specific policy on calendars.  And honestly, I don't see a problem with people keeping their calendars private.  My calendar is open, and I expect to keep it that way - that's my personal decision because I think it helps to continue to foster the message that I/we are open and transparent about the business. That said, in addition to the personal privacy points that have already been made, as the company gets bigger and the types of deals and the customers we work with also get bigger, we will need to have several \"confidential\" meetings that will appear on calendar.",

            "Hi, Happy New Year!\nThe new minimum wage will not affect any of the benefits that we receive as Wizeliners. The reason is that our salaries are based in monthly gross amounts and the rest of the benefits such as Food Coupons and Savings Fund are tied to the UMA (Unidad de Medida y Actualización). New amounts for the UMA during this year will be published in the DOF (Diario Oficial de la Federación) on January the 10th and will affect our payments starting February the 1st. We will be sending an email with the updates as soon as they are communicated.",

For the year, we are going to be closer to $25M, which means that we will not be paying out the revenue-based bonus.\n\nPlease refer to this email for more context about our 2018 company performance against  our target.\n\nThank you!',

            "Hi Felipe! Thank you for your question.  At Wizeline, employees benefit from a 30-days Christmas Bonus or  *proportional* to days worked in the given year (2018). This bonus is paid on December 20, the latest, by law. \n\nPlease note that the amount you receive is taxable. For deduction purposes, SAT takes into consideration your whole monthly income (including both payroll periods and Christmas Bonus) and based on this, the proper tax is deducted. \n\nE.g., if you worked at Wizeline for all 2018, you will basically be receiving a whole month of salary (30 days). If you joined the company in early March 2018, by this December 2018, you will be receiving the corresponding 83% of a 30-days salary.",

        Answer: {
          answer:
            "A. appreciate the question B. appreciate that it wasn't anonymous and C. appreciate your willingness to help.\n\nSo first, I'll speak to my philosophy on life:\n+ I feel incredibly lucky and am thankful for the opportunities I've had\n+ If you have your health, the sun will always rise and you have an opportunity to improve things\n+ Finding out of a terminal illness or the sudden loss of a relative - in my book - is what counts as a bad day\n\nSo as long as there are no surprises about health, I believe that you are in the game and you have the power to make a challenging situation - better.  So that's where this boils down to, more or less challenging situations. Below, I'll include a few of the challenging days and what we're doing to make them better or what we did.\n\n1. Nat Geo scales down projects with Wizeline\nDetail: In early November, we found out that Nat Geo - due to the Fox/Nat Geo transaction - would be scaling down their projects - even though they were very happy.  This was a surprise to them and a big surprise to us.  This would definitely impact our revenue numbers for the year.  And if we had been a public company, it would've tanked our stock.\nResolution: We immediately started to work with Nat Geo to see if we could come up with different payment terms and/or keep people on projects even if they didn't pay us. When this didn't work, the team mobilized to help put people on new projects quickly so the team wouldn't stay idle.  We're still working through this, but now we're trying to minimize the impact to our operating plan in 2019 by bringing on new logos.\n2. Apax wanted to update terms for our series B at the last minute\nDetail: A year ago, we signed the term sheet for our series B with Apax.  But finalizing the funding round took longer than expected because Apax's Investment Committee was very concerned that our revenue was too concentrated within News Corp.  At the last minute they required that we add a ratchet which would dilute ownership if we didn't hit certain revenue metrics.\nResolution: We decided to accept the ratchet because getting capital into the business was more important so we could invest in our people and the business.  We would try to negotiate down the ratchet in the future if we didn't hit the revenue number, but most importantly, we would just build a really big and successful business so any type of dilution wouldn't matter.\n3. Fox News commented that they were going to stop a project due to performance\nDetail: Our main contact at Fox News sent an email saying that he had heard that our performance has waned and would be ending the relationship with us.\nResolution: We looked into it and found out that it was a communication issue.  The team continued to perform and we recently signed a new contract to scale the platform.\n\nIn terms of what you can do to help. Come in, every day, with a positive attitude and a desire to help your team and customers build great technology and make a difference!",

            'Hello, thank you for letting us know and we will like to share with everybody how we order the "special menus". The process is to notify facilities through an email if you would like to be in these menus (light, vegetarian, vegan). The quantity of these dishes is based on the people who have notified and are on these lists (catering has them as well) and we add 3 more plates just in case. \nWe thought of doing it this way trying to avoid food waste, if you would like to be considered in this menu on regular basis or if you see the menu and on a specific day you would prefer to have the light menu, please send us an email to facilities-gdl@wizeline.com.',

          "It seems that since we moved to Zoom we have a very very low audio quality. It might be related to the fact that microphones are fixed to the wall... I just had a meeting where someone was presenting smthg, it was basically impossible to follow the pres. Most of the times it is hard to hear people on zoom meetings, even sometimes 1:1s. I think this problem is critical: If we can't properly communicate remotely, what can we do?\nIs there a way we can have portable mics in the rooms for instance?",

Every time we have a meeting with all the company we have audio problems due to people speaking far from the mics or due to it catches a lot of ambience noice. Maybe a couple of wireless mics for the presenter and for the audience can work better. Also that involves a friendly remote communication culture that can be addressed since the onboarding process.
